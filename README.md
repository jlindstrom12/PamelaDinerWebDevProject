HTML, CSS, and Javascript files to create a website for Pamela's Diner

This website was made purly using HTML, CSS, and Javascript files
No frameworks were used. The goal was to learn the basics of website devlopment and
to understand the layout using CSS without the use of frameworks. 

Overall I learned alot about CSS and JQuery features to enhance websites.
